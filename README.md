# Power-BI_Project

In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize data from a survey of 630 data professionals across various job titles, countries, and demographics.

Key Processes:

Data Source: Imported raw survey data from Excel, which included diverse responses from professionals in the data industry. Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing entries. Data Transformation: Used Power Query to create calculated columns and measures, such as average salary, happiness index, and counts by job title and programming language. Data Modeling: Established relationships between different tables to enable multidimensional analysis by country, job title, and gender. Calculated Columns & Measures: Developed custom measures to compute key metrics like average salary by job title/gender and happiness index based on work-life balance and salary satisfaction. Dashboard Visualizations:

Geographical Breakdown: A map visual to show the distribution of survey participants by country. Salary Analysis: Bar charts comparing average salaries across job titles and between genders. Happiness Index Gauges: Visual representations of happiness indices related to work-life balance and salary. Programming Language Preferences: A stacked bar chart highlighting the most popular programming languages among different roles. Interactivity: Added slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration by various dimensions.

Outcome: The final dashboard provided clear insights into job satisfaction, salary trends, and demographic distributions among data professionals. This project demonstrated my ability to manage the entire data analysis process—from data preparation to insightful visualization—showcasing my proficiency in Power BI.
